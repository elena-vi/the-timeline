# The timeline
## Blogging Service Brief
### Vision
We've had a new idea for a blogging service. Users can post messages of up to 150 characters in length which will appear on their timeline in descending chronological order.

Users will eventually be able to follow other users and are in turn able to be followed themselves.

We believe this to be a very unique and exciting idea.
